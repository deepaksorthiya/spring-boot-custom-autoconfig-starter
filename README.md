### ** Spring Boot Custom User Define Auto Configuration Example **

---

# Getting Started

### Requirements:

```
Git: 2.49.0
Spring Boot: 3.5.0
Maven: 3.9+
Java: 24
```

### Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepaksorthiya/spring-boot-custom-autoconfig-starter.git
cd spring-boot-custom-autoconfig-starter
```

### Build Jar File and Run Tests:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Usage

To use this starter you will need to add the following dependency to your spring boot project.

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-custom-autoconfig-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

And configure the following properties in your `application.properties` file. The reason I made this a setting is
because you might
want to run JsonPlaceHolder Service locally or in a different environment. If you don't configure one the default will
be used.

```properties
json-placeholder-service.base-url=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```
